phoc (0.43~rc1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * treewide: Ack unstable gmobile api in a single place. No need to clutter
    all source files
  * input-method-relay: Only submit preedit when not empty.
    We checked for NULL but need to also check for the empty string as
    otherwise multiple clicks confuse the client and e.g. GTK4 looses text
    when double clicking with a pointer.
    Fixes c252b39d0 ("input-method-relay: Allow to submit preedit")

  * cursor: Add G_END_DECLS
  * cursor: Make cursor_client private
  * cursor: Move setting of cursor from theme to PhocCursor.
    No need to have it in the seat.
  * cursor: Save one indent level
  * treewide: Use default cursor name.
    No need to go via a fixed theme default. This allows us to drop the
    default cursor from PhocCursor.
  * cursor: Add getters and setters for the cursor mode
  * cursor: Make mode private
  * cursor: Move cursor image handling to cursor.
    It was split between cursor and seat before. To handle that
    introduce `set_image` and `set_name` methods that either
    set a cursor by its name or a surface.
    We also do away with the special `NULL` name handling and let `NULL`
    rather mean "unset cursor".
  * seat: Move cursor setting to PhocCursor.
    No need to go via seat.
    Helps: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/231
  * cursor: Rename cursor_client to image_client.
    It's the client that sets the cursor image not e.g. a client tracked by
    the cursor.
  * xcursor: Drop file.
    It has only a couple of defines that fit into PhocCursor just as well.
  * cursor: Only show cursor if we have motion events.
    Many tablets expose a pointing device that isn't usable. Instead of
    having to override that via libinput rather only ever show a cursor if
    we had a motion event.
  * cursor: Allow to set theme
  * seat: Move xcursor handling to cursor.
    No need to have parts on the seat
  * cursor: Make xcursor_manager private
  * cursor: Chain up to constructed first.
    The parent constructor should get a chance to run first
  * cursor: Attach output layout in constructor.
    Makes the server more self contained
  * cursor: Set cursor theme via GSettings.
    We do that at the very end as we already need the output layout mapping
    set up.
    Close: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/6
  * po: Fix path to phoc-dev unit.
    Fixes efecd3612 ("build: Setup i18n")
  * docs: Mention examples
  * ci: Update shared scripts to 891d0bd
  * ci: Check our markdown.
    This makes sure we don't regress
  * xdg-popup: Delay damaging to the next commit.
    We want to make sure the old popup position gets damaged but not before
    the client submits a new buffer. Otherwise we might see the popup
    flickering at the old position.
    This fixes flickering selection bubbles in e.g. gnome-text-editor when
    repositioning them quickly.

  * output: Check for shell reveal before scanning a fullscreen view out.
    Otherwise the shell will remain hidden (but accepting input) whenever
    the fullscreen surface behind it can be scanned out directly.

  [ Evangelos Ribeiro Tzaras ]
  * output: Fix possible segfault with XWayland views.
    Surface might be NULL here, so check before dereferencing it.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/382

phoc (0.42.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * cursor: Don't submit pending im state without a surface.
    Avoids hitting the assert() when dragging a window with server side
    decorations.
    Fixes: 11ac332cf ("cursor: Submit preedit on mouse/touch down")
  * view: Ease focus debugging.
    Allow to print which view tried to get initial focus with which token.
  * seat: Ack that phoc_seat_view_from_view always succeeds.
    If it doesn't it's a programming error.
  * seat: Simplify phoc_seat_set_focus_layer.
    As we're using a queue (since some time now) we can make this easier to
    read.
  * output: Check correct layer surface.
    We're checking the stacked surface a couple of lines above. We want
    to check the target here.

phoc (0.42~rc1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * treewide: Fix docstrings
  * view: Clarify scale.
    There's surface scales, scale-to-fit scales, buffer scales, …, let's
    explain what this one refers to.
  * output: Document PhocSurfaceIterator.
    It should rather be PhocSurfaceIteratorFunc as it's the funcion invoked
    by the various iterators.
  * layer-surface: Handle destroy in PhocLayerSurface.
    Another bit moved.
  * layer-shell: Make child creation/destruction available to PhocLayerSurface.
    We want to move the PhocLayerSurface handling to the class
    implementation. Since popups and subsurfaces are currently handled in
    layer-shell we need to make them available to PhocLayerSurface.
    We do so by introducing a private header which we can then reuse when we
    move the popups and subsurfaces out of layer-shell too.
    This leaks a bit of popup setup details as we expose
    phoc_layer_popup_unconstrain() too but we can fix that up when
    introducing the PhocLayerPopup object.
  * layer-surface: Handle unmap in PhocLayerSurface
  * layer-surface: Make damage() private.
    It's only user unmap() is now handled within the class
  * layer-surface: Handle map in PhocLayerSurface
  * layer-surface: Handle new_popup in PhocLayerSurface.
    We leak a bit of popup setup but we'll fix that when introducing an
    PhocLayerPopup object in the future.
  * layer-surface: Don't forget to remove new_popup handler
  * layer-surface: Move surface_commit to PhocLayerSurface
  * layer-surface: Move adding to output list to PhocLayerSurfce.
    With this we have the listener setup / removal and list manipulation all
    in PhocLayerSurface making it match the destruction bits that moved in
      0a1d0d09e ("layer-surface: Move object destruction to finalize")
    and `phoc_handle_layer_shell_surface ()` can focus on determining the
    output and arranging layers.
  * layer-shell: Make header match symbol prefix.
    Since the dawn of time the header name didn't match the symbol
    prefix (`phoc_layer_shell`). Fix that and rename the C file
    while at that too.
    Fixes: c960805d9 ("Initial commit")
  * layer-surface: Add and use phoc_layer_surface_get_mapped()
  * view: Use self in phoc_view_maximize
  * view: Use self in view_restore
  * view: Use self in phoc_view_tile
  * view: Add decorated property.
    Use it to toggle the decoration. This will allow us to toggle
    decorations based on different factors like window state.
  * view: Add state property.
    This tracks whether the view is floating, tiled or maximized
  * text-input: Use C style comments.
    While we're cleaning up anyway fix some indent too.
  * text-input: Drop underscore from file name.
    This makes it match other source files. Rename to the class
    name while at that.
  * input-method-relay: Move unsetting focus to separate function.
    This makes it more descriptive and we'll add more code there soon.
  * input-method-relay: Submit pending preedit on focus out.
    This ensures we don't lose the preedit when the client has preedit and
    loses focus.
    See https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Chatty/-/issues/864#note_1962513
  * input-method-relay: Allow to submit preedit.
    Add a function that resets the current IMs preedit
  * cursor: Submit preedit on mouse/touch down.
    This ensures we submit the preedit when e.g.the user opens a menu
    or clicks in another location in the text entry field

phoc (0.41.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * seat: Track last button and touch serials
  * xdg-surface: Validate serials for move and resize.
    We don't care if the serial is from a touch down or button event event
    atm.
    Two more TODOs out of the way
  * output: Fix phys_height condition.
    We want to set it when the height is set, not the width.
    Fixes: 128483f6a ("output: Allow to configure physical width and height")

 -- Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org>  Thu, 15 Aug 2024 08:19:20 +0200

phoc (0.41.0~rc1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * subprojects: Update wlroots to 0.17.4
  * idle-inhibit: Cancel DBus call before freeing an inhibitor.
    Otherwise we might end up accessing already gone memory if the async
    call ending in `on_screensaver_inhibit_finish` is still in progress.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/375
  * layer-shell-effects: When folded reject fling that wouldn't unfold.
    When a surface is folded we reject a fling that doesn't go into the
    unfold direction.
    This prevents us picking up the gesture when an ongoing fling on another
    surface crosses this surface. This can e.g. happen when swipe closing
    apps in phosh where one crosses the top bar during the fling.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/380

phoc (0.40.1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * layer-surface: Rename helper.
    The actual unmap happens in `handle_unmap`.
  * layer-shell: Mark layer cache dirty when OSK changes layers.

phoc (0.40.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * keyboard: Modernize indent.
    PhocKeyboard is one of the earlier GObjects. Let it catch up with
    current indent.
  * keyboard: Use C style comments
  * keyboard: Chain up to parent's constructed first.
    We want to initialize the parent first. The other children of
    PhocInputDevice to that correctly already.
  * keyboard: Move signals above class
  * subprojects: Update wlroots to 0.17.3
  * tracing: Drop unused variables
  * gesture: Fix indent
  * cursor: Name drag gesture accordingly.
    This makes it distinguishable from other gestures.
  * cursor: Drop cursor_gestures_handle_event.
    We can fold it into handle_gestures_for_event_at
  * layer-shell-effects: Reduce time for fold/unfold animation.
    Feels more snappy without being too hectic.
  * gesture: Allow to retrieve last event sequence
  * layer-shell-effects: Split out is_handle check.
    Will be useful in a follow up commit
  * layer-shell-effects: Allow to fling fold/unfold a draggable surface.
    When the velocity is high enough the surface fold/unfold is animated.
    We don't take the velocity into account for the animation.
  * cursor: Detect swipe gestures.
    Apply them to draggable layer surfaces if present. This allows to
    fling them away with a high velocity swipe gesture.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/284
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phosh/-/issues/792
  * output: Handle NULL output gracefully.
    It's a bit simpler than adding `if (!output)` at the call sites
  * seat: Handle NULL output gracefully.
    We can't arrange layers on gone outputs.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/257
  * desktop: Simplify phoc_desktop_surface_at.
    The function becomes quick to parse if we remove the assignments
    out of the if() clauses and get the output coordinates upfront
    as they apply to both layer surface blocks.
  * desktop: Add wlr to desktop_surface_at.
    Makes it consistent with phoc_view_get_wlr_surface_at
  * output: Get getter for wlr_output.
    We catch lots of errors via type asserts so add a getter with
    that.
  * output: Clear wlr_output->data pointer.
    This points to self which is about to be finalized, clear it out so
    other parts don't access the gone output.
  * desktop: Don't forget to remove the gone output from the layout.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/155
  * tests: Use MALLOC_PERTURB_
  * layer-surface: Add layer getter
  * layer-shell-effects: Drop hash table for alpha layer surfaces.
    We don't need to look up by layer surface so no need to maintain the
    hash.
  * output: Make phoc_output_for_each_surface private
  * output: Clarify phoc_output_get_layer_surfaces_for_layer
  * output: Use a GQueue for the layer surfaces.
    This allows us to go forward and backwards easily.
  * desktop: Use phoc_output_get_layer_surfaces_for_layer.
    This makes sure we confine the layer surface iteration to
    PhocOutput.
  * output: Unify layer surface iteration logic.
    Use phoc_output_get_layer_surfaces_for_layer to iterate the
    surfaces in phoc_output_layer_for_each_surface. This unifies
    layer surface iteration in one place.
  * output: Move queue ownership to output.
    This will allow us to cache it
  * output: Cache layer surface ordering.
    Instead of recalculating on each access cache the ordering
    and make bits that might change the ordering (such as committing
    a layer surface) invalidate the cache.
    This also works towards removing more double accounting in this area.
  * layer-shell-effects: Allow to tweak stacking.
    The stacked-layer-surface protocol allows to stack a layer surface
    directly above or below another layer surface.
  * desktop: Allow to get layer surface stacks
  * output: Process layer surface stackings
  * ci: Fix drm backend build on alpine.
    It needs libdisplay-panel-info
  * doc: Document help and disable-animations flag
  * settings: Split out boolean option parsing
  * output: Simplify update_output_manager_config
    wlr_output_configuration_head_v1_create already sets the values from
    the passed in output.
  * output: Apply drm panel orientation.
    If `drm-panel-orientation` is set to `true` in phoc.ini apply the panel
    orientation transform by default.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/192
  * utils: Ignore displays that encode aspect ratio rather than size.
    This is based on sway's 2f84d6e349d12f3293c44268bc5c8551340e5787 which
    in turn got inspired by mutter.
  * output: Allow to configure physical width and height.
    This can be useful in case edid is off or if we're on a nested
    display (like Wayland or X11)
  * output: Print output info at the very end.
    This allows us to see (possibly overridden) physical size.

phoc (0.39.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * gitlab-ci: Update base image to 2024-04-04.
    Otherwise gcovr fails on us when a submodule has tests disabled.
  * build: Update to gmobile 0.1.0
  * build: Allow to use shared gmobile.
    This makes it a bit simpler to keep notch information up to date.
  * packaging: Ignore gmobile related files
  * doc: Add --skip-subprojects to install.
    This avoids putting gmobile headers and shared objects into the system.
    Switch to using meson while at it
  * settings: Mark some functions as skip.
    This avoids warnings when creating introspection data
  * doc-check: Be more strict
  * tests/xwayland: Wait a bit.
    Wait until the frame got rendered as we otherwise might snapshot
    the previous frame
  * keyboard: Fix indent of keyboard_execute_compositor_binding
  * desktop: Reindent pointer_constraint helpers.
    We move the g_new0 to it's separate line to not hide an allocation in a
    variable declaration, use casts where appropriate.
  * cursor: Don't unlink constraint_commit twice.
    It's unlinked a couple of lines above already.
  * cursor: Deduplicate pointer motion.
    Absolute and relative motion were doing very similar things but
    differently. Use a single function for the common bits.
  * desktop: Drop duplicate include.
    Fixes: c960805d ("Initial commit")
  * color-rect: Premultiply the alpha value.
    This is how render_pass expects it. Fixup the existing animations using
    alpha for that.
  * color-rect: Don't render if unmapped.
    Otherwise we might end up with changed screen state although the
    rect is unmapped.
  * types: Make it simple to compare colors
  * color-rect: Add setter for color.
    This allows us to use g_notify_by_psepc()
  * color-rect: Allow to set alpha.
    So far we only allowed setting the full color, allow to set
    alpha so we can drive the animation.
  * desktop: Add animation when always-on-top is toggled on/off
  * time-animation: Fix use after free
  * main: Include locale.h.
    Needed for LC_MESSAGES
    Fixes the -Dbuildtype=debug build
  * seat: Make seat-views a queue and private.
    Queues are a bit easier on the eyes.
  * seat: Make has_focus private
  * seat: Reverse window cycle focus order.
    Cycling "backward" now means to focus the view that previously had focus
    while moving forward means to focus the view that was out of focus for
    the longest time.
    With this we correctly focus the last focused view when cycling via
    keyboard shortcuts and then closing a window.
    It also fixes the case where opening an application and cycling backward
    would not get one back to the previous application.
  * main: Include locale.h to fix -Dbuildtype=debug build
  * output: Disconnect render_outputs signal from the correct object.
    Otherwise we might try to access an already gone output in render_cutouts
  * build: Indent by two spaces
  * build: The wlroots library is a subproject wrap.
    Fixes: e9b9ef02 ("build: Use meson wrap for the wlroots submodule")
  * build: Add tests to summary
  * build: Separate generated sources and headers.
    This reduces the  number of build steps from 465 to 222 (when linking
    against a shared wlroots).
  * desktop: Fix typo.
    We're looking at phosh's schema here
  * docs: Expand on configuration.
    Mention where we read configuration from and list the schemas and keys
    phoc currently uses.

  [ MoonlightWave-12 ]
  * docs: Update links in README.md.
    The links were outdated and some did not work anymore.
    The link to the documentation for GLib now links directly
    to the relevant part about environment-variables.
    Also add links to the files `debian/control` and
    `src/phoc.ini.example`, to make those easier to open.
  * docs: Update link to libhandy in HACKING.md
    and remove an unused and outdated link.
  * docs: Fix typos in doc/gettingstarted.md.
    Also add a few commas for better readability.
  * docs: Add `./` to commands for running scripts from source-tree.
    To make it clearer that those have to be entered as paths to the scripts.
  * docs: Add more syntax-highlighting

  [ Sam Day ]
  * keyboard: Udev configuration for "wakeup keys"
    If a keyboard has an underlying udev device, and that device has
    properties matching PHOC_WAKEUP_KEY_, these properties are used to
    determine whether a particular key (or all keys) from that device will
    trigger activity events or not.

phoc (0.38.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * input-device: Add a helper to detect keyboards.
    Should this prove inefficient we can look at ID_INPUT_KEYBOARD
    udev property.
  * seat: Check for keyboard more thoroughly.
    We only want to announce keyboard capabilities if there's actually
    a hw keyboard (and not just buttons).
  * protocols/device-state: Add keyboard capability
  * device-state: Report hw keyboard capability.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/98
  * example/device-state: Use protocol version 2
  * packaging: Use pkgconf
    pkg-config is deprecated
  * manpage: Fix typos
  * build: Validate desktop file
  * build: Validate schema
  * treewide: Move to mobi.phosh prefix.
    We don't change the schema id's to not break existing installations.
  * wlroots: Update to 0.17.2
  * output: Simplify condition.
    No need to for inverse logic.
  * output: Adjust scale to fractional-scale-v1.
    When reading scale form configuration or updated heads make sure we use
    a scale that works for the fractional-scale-v1 protocol.
  * xdg-shell: Notify popups about fractional/buffer scale changes.
    Otherwise the popup might see outdated fractional scale information and
    become blurry.
    To reproduce:
      - Start at scale 100%,
      - scale to 200 via g-c-c (GNOME Settings)
      - open the scale popup again: The scaled numbers in there are blurry
        while the main window has sharp text.
    Note: tiling the window after changing scale hides the problem as the
    move ensures updated scale information is sent to the view and all
    children.
  * view: Add common map function for ViewChilds.
    Consolidate in one place to avoid errors fixed in the previous commit.
    Once ViewChild is a GObject we can chain up "naturally".
  * view: Add common unmap function for ViewChilds.
    Once ViewChild is a GObject we can chain up "naturally".
  * treewide: Use "Phosh Developers" insteady of myself as copyright holders
  * treewide: Remove unneeded cast around g_object_new()
    It gives us the right type anyway. Turns out our yasnippet
    had that wrong and so it ended up in about all classes.
  * desktop: Bump layer shell version to 3.
    Version 3 adds the layer_shell object destructor only.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/364
  * view: Better document parent child relationship
    parent, parent_link and stack are all concerned with the view stack.
    Cleanup indent while at that.
  * view: Improve docstring
  * view: Add docstring for phoc_view_restore()
  * seat: Indent seat_raise_view_stack
  * keybindings: Return early without a view.
    Use the same pattern in all view related keybinding handlers
  * desktop: Get config from server singleton.
    No need to maintain this as extra property. We did this for some initial
    uncluttering but that's long fixed.
  * desktop: Turn list of views into a queue and make it private.
    This will allow for some upcoming changes and also improves readability
    a bit as we get function names instead of just list manipulation.
    We need to take the indirection via `priv` for the moment until we made
    all of desktop private.
  * desktop: Handle always-on-top.
    This allows views to stay on top (e.g. video players).
    When a view is raised it's already mapped as well as new children are
    raised too to avoid a parent hiding it's children. We don't raise any
    parents in order to e.g. allow to raise a single window of an
    application.
    To activate you need to bind a keyboard shortcut
      gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings always-on-top "['<super>t']"
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/342
  * desktop: Damage view when raising it.
    This frees the seat from any view related damage handling.
  * view: Implement move-to-corner.
    These are unbound by default, test with e.g.
      gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-corner-nw "['<super>y']"
      gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-corner-ne "['<super>u']"
      gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-corner-sw "['<super>i']"
      gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-corner-se "['<super>o']"
    We currently reject scale-to-fit, maximized and fullscreened views for
    that as we want to simplify the scale-to-fit vs saved geometry handling
    first. See https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/362
  * view: Make view-child a GObject.
    We use the same pattern as with PhocView and allow for public struct
    members so derived classes can access them easily. Since PhocView and
    PhocViewChild are still entangled we leave most of the member functions
    in PhocView for the moment. They'll be moved in follow up commits.
    We need to rename phoc_view_child_init() to not clash with the GObject
    init function.
  * view-child: Add view and surface properties.
    We don't take ref on the view yet as the current code doesn't transfer
    ownership either. We can improve on that once we have the objects in
    place.
  * xdg-shell: Make xdg-popup a minimal GObject.
    The code will move into xdg-suface later.
  * xdg-shell: Create/destroy popup as GObject
  * view: Make subsurface a minimal GObject
  * view: Create/destroy subsurfaces as GOjects
  * view: Move PhocViewChild's public functions over too.
    We skip phoc_view_child_setup() for now as it accesses view's
    private data.
    Since we now have our own compilation unit we can rename `child`
    to `self` to ease readability.
  * view-child: Move most of phoc_view_child_destroy into finalize.
    For that we pull the `g_object_unref` from the custom destroy handlers
    into `phoc_view_child_destroy`.
  * view-child: Use GObject virtual functions for destroy and get_pos.
    This allows us to drop the ViewChildInterface.
  * view-child: Move most of the ViewChild's setup into constructed.
    This allows us to drop more arguments from phoc_view_child_setup() as
    those are already passed to the object constructor.
  * view-child: Add map / unmap virtual methods.
    This allows us to drop the implementation in the derived classes
    completely (while we could still override them if needed).
  * xdg-shell: Use popup constructor.
    Thus we can drop phoc_xdg_popup_create().
    The phoc_xdg_popup_new() invocations without consuming the return value
    look a bit odd but the ref is dropped in handle_destroy. This is the
    same pattern we use for other surface types.
  * view-child: Drop phoc_view_child_destroy()
    We can simply drop the only reference.
  * subsurface: Use casts instead of accessing `child` directly.
    This improves readability and allows us to rename to parent_instance.
  * xdg-popup: Move popup class into it's own file.
    We might want to merge xdg-surface and xdg-popup back into an
    xdg-shell at some point as they serve the originate from the same
    Wayland protocol but let's have this split for now to disentangle
    xdg_shell.
  * xdg-popup: Use GObject generated casts consistently
  * xdg-shell: Move surface creation handler to xdg-surface
  * xdg-surface: Tighten role check
  * xdg-shell: Rename to xdg-toplevel-decoration.
    That's the only bit handled in there now. This allows us to move
    decoration related bits into the matching header too.
  * layer-shell: Move handler into layer-shell related header.
    We ought to rename the header too at some point but there's outstanding
    MRs we don't want to break.
  * output: Prefix handlers.
    Now all public functions are properly namespaced.
  * doc-check: Drop namespace exception.
    Public methods are now properly prefixed.
  * docs: Enable fatal warnings during doc build.
    This makes sure we no longer ignore links that became stale or are
    mistyped.
    See phosh commit 8c4724e44c6727f36bed4fd67e853bddf17b6ccd
  * view: Add and use phoc_view_add_child()
    This ensures the child doesn't access the view's private data.
  * view-child: Move adding to parent's list into constructed.
    One more bit to get rid of phoc_view_child_setup().
  * view-child: Move subsurface creation to constructed too.
    This allows us to drop phoc_view_child_setup(). The only view child
    private method left in view.c is phoc_view_child_subsurface_create()
    which we can remove once subsurface creation becomes public.
  * subsurface: Move into it's own file.
    This disentangles subsurface handling from view handling (positioning,
    window state, etc)
  * subsurface: Add and use wlr-subsurface property
  * subsurface: Move setup into constructed.
    This makes subsurface creation for views and view-children more alike.
  * view-child: Move subsurface creation out of view.
    With subsurface being it's own class we can now move this bit
    over to PhocViewChild too.
  * subsurface: Make struct private.
    Neither view nor view-child require direct member access anymore.
  * view: Use subsurface constructor directly.
    The fact that we don't store the ref isn't ideal. At some point we want
    to move the `handle_destroy` handlers to their containers and drop the
    ref there. This isn't worse than before though, it's just more visible.
  * popup: Use self consistently.
    When these bits were part of view.c we used `popup` to not confuse with
    `self` meaning `view`. This can be fixed now.
    Let's do this now since there can't be any outstanding MRs touching
    this file.
  * popup: Wait for commit before unconstraining popup.
    This fixes a critical:
      [types/xdg_shell/wlr_xdg_surface.c:169] A configure is scheduled for an uninitialized xdg_surface [address]
  * view-child: Add and use view property getter.
    This looks a bit nicer.
  * output: Drop superfluous 'local' from damage helpers.
    The names are long enough already
  * view: Don't init subsurfaces twice.
    The code in phoc_view_init_subsurfaces() does as same things the code in
    map() just above the invocation does.
    Fixes: c2e903e6 ("view: Move subsurface initialization to separate function")
    which added the function but didn't remove the code in _map().

phoc (0.37.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * phosh-private: Add XF86Screensaver to the list of subscribable symbols.
  * doc-check: Allow for pixman_region32_t to be unrsolved.
    Some upcoming helpers will have this function argument.
  * util: Introduce phoc_util_is_box_damaged.
    This will be helpful for damage tracking when switching to render_pass.
    It is similar to is_damge in the renderer but we want it public as e.g.
    blings will want to use that too.
  * output: Add helpers to transform boxes and regions.
    This will be useful when switching to render_pass
  * render: Clarify buffer render vs scanout rendering.
    Rendering to a buffer uses the legacy renderer while rendering targeting
    scanout is using render_pass. Make it clear where the view render
    itertor fits in.
  * render: Switch to wlr_render_pass.
    This switches us to wlr_render_pass and to wlr_output_commit_state.
    phoc_renderer_render_view_to_buffer keeps using wlr_renderer directly as
    it needs wlr_renderer_readpixels. This will be fixed when switching to
    0.18.x and wlr_texture_read_pixels.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/344
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/346
  * output: Add scale filter mode.
    This allows to use different texture filters based on output scale.  For
    fractional we use bilinear filtering and for integer scales the nearest
    filtering (as we don't need to scale down).
  * settings: Allow to set output scale-filter
  * layer-shell-effects: Better document drag handle.
    The current description made it impossible to figure out how it works
    without looking at the code.
  * server: Fix docstring.
    Fixes: ac4e8bbc ("server: Exit when session exits")
  * docs: Update dependent libraries.
    Add phoc and glib. Since wlroots is documented in the source
    code we link to the git repository.
  * docs: Add urlmap.
    This allows for external linking
  * treewide: Add TODOs.
    Add TODOs for the remaining classes we want to encapsulat
  * treewide: Use phoc_server_get_desktop()
    We had about all combinations:
    - Fetching the server, then the desktop
    - Fetching the server, then using server->desktop directly
    - Using phoc_server_get_desktop ()
    - Using phoc_server_get_default ()->desktop
    As we want PhocDesktop in all cases use
      PhocDesktop *desktop = phoc_server_get_desktop (phoc_server_get_default ());
    consistently. Only in the few places that use server and desktop use
      PhocDesktop *desktop = phoc_server_get_desktop (server);
    We also move fetching the desktop to the top of functions and clean up
    some minor misindents along the way.
  * server: Make desktop private.
    This makes sure we only access the desktop that way.
  * server: Make session startup related variables private
  * server: Make init flag private
  * treewide: Add and use phoc_server_get_input()
    This brings it in line with phoc_server_get_desktop() making
    an explicit server variable unnecessary in many functions.
  * server: Make input private
  * server: Add and use phoc_server_get_config()
    This gets it in line with phoc_server_get_desktop()
  * server: Make config private
  * server: Make flags private
  * server: Fix doc string
  * server: Add and use phoc_server_get_debug_flags()
    This gets it in line with phoc_server_get_desktop()
  * server: Make debug flags private
  * treewide: Add and use phoc_server_get_wl_display()
    This gets it in line with phoc_server_get_desktop()
  * server: Make wl_display private
  * server: Make wl_source private
  * server: Make wlr_subcompositor private
  * treewide: Add and use phoc_server_get_backend()
    This gets it in line with phoc_server_get_desktop()
  * server: Make backend private
  * treewide: Use phoc_server_get_render()
    This gets it in line with phoc_server_get_desktop()
  * server: Make renderer private
  * treewide: Add and use phoc_server_get_compositor()
    This gets it in line with phoc_server_get_desktop()
  * server: Make compositor private
  * server: Make data device manager private
  * server: Drop private data.
    As the server is not derivable we can use `self` directly now
    that all data members are private.
  * layer-shell: Improve indent.
    Use full line length, drop superfluos braces and add space before
    function's (). No functional change.
  * layer-shell: Drop phoc_ prefix
  * layer-shell: Use wlr_ prefix for wlr's subsurfaces
  * layer-shell: Drop phoc prefix from phoc's subsurface
  * layer-shell: Add phoc prefix to layer_subsurface_new()
    Make is consistent with other constructors.
  * layer-shell: Prefix destructor.
    Makes it consistent with the constructor
  * text-input: Indent fixes
  * utils: Fix prefix
  * view: Uncrustify view_update_output.
    Let's clean that up before making more changes.
  * output: Move scale updates to separate function
  * view: Move surface enter/leave handling to separate function
  * utils: Update buffer scale when a surface enters/leaves an output.
    Besides doing sending the preferred buffer scale on output scale changes
    we also need to do so when a view moves to another output.
    Fixes: 07315fc7 ("output: Refresh textures on scale changes")
  * treewide: Add support for fractional-scale-v1 protocol.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/345
  * view: Update surface scale on subsurface map.
    Use our new helper for that.
  * layer-shell: Send surface scale on map.
    Use the surface helper to not only notify about output enter but also
    buffer and fractional scale.
  * tests: Use pixman renderer.
    We mosty test positioning / stacking so use a renderer that works well
    in containers.
    If we want to test renderer related bits we can set the renderer
    explicitly.
  * xwayland-surface: Setup view before maximizing.
    Otherwise initially maximized XWayland views aren't rendered.
    Fixes: 1e9df0a2 ("treewide: Adjust to map logic changes")
  * drag-icon: Move into it's own file.
    There's no need for a GObject but it unclutters the seat. This is the
    minimal code move.
  * drag-icon: Add and use is_mapped()
    As in phoc_view_is_mapped() we handle NULL gracefully to simplify
    the checking.
  * drag-icon: Add getters
  * output: Use drag-icon getters
  * drag-icon: Make struct private.
    We don't bother with a GObject until we need properties for e.g.
    animations.
  * output: Use drag-icon header.
    This allows us to drop the forward declaration

  [ Sergey Lisov ]
  * seat: Respect touchscreen to output mapping from wlroots
    wlroots' touchscreen objects (struct wlr_touch) have the "output_name"
    field, which specifies the corresponding output device, from wlroots' own
    point of view. Use these mappings if present not explicitly overridden by
    gsettings.
    This fixes the issue where touch inputs do not get rotated with the screen
    when changing device orientation on setups where wlroots provides this
    information (such as when running nested).

phoc (0.36.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * ci: Use our ci template.
    This avoids an external dependency and unbreaks ci
  * ci: Update shared scripts.
    Update shared scripts to commit 04a85df2f3311f3012b6c49bf353b376ae0f32b2
    (matching the ci template).
    This isn't strictly necessary but avoids config drift.
  * po: Add de template.
    We want one template to make the po check happy
  * ci: Add po check.
    Just use our shared ci template for that
  * ci: Add commit message style checks.
    Since we pulled in the config in the previous commit let's add the check
    as well.
  * d/control: Update URL.
    While at that fix the section and update the standards version
  * view: Prefix view_unmap.
    No functional change.
  * view: Prefix view_is_ getters.
    This makes them show up in the docs
  * view: Don't leak details of view arrangement.
    Instead of leaking the details how view are layed out keep that
    local to view.
  * view: Use phoc_view_arrange()
    Use phoc_view_arrange() internally too.
  * keybindings: Avoid self for keybinding.
    The object in this unit is PhocKeybindings so don't use self for a
    single keybinding to avoid confusion.
  * keybindings: Allow for a parameter
  * keybindings: Use a single handler to move a view
  * view: Name public functions consistently
  * keybindings: Prefix parse_accelerator.
    It's a public function
  * gtk-shell: Make phoc_gtk_{shell,surface}_from_resource static.
    No need to have them public.
  * doc-check: Make namespace check more strict.
    The only bits not properly namespaced are wlroots signal handlers that
    are located in other compilation units.
  * view: Fix doc string
  * view-deco: New class for decoration handling.
    We'll turn it into a full bling but let's move functionality into a
    separate class first.  As we set the same decoration sizes keep this
    internal to PhocViewDeco.
  * view-deco: Make PhocViewDeco a bling.
    This way we don't need special handling for decorations in
    output and renderer
  * view: Nuke view_update_decorated.
    Just call phoc_view_set_decarated
  * view: Drop decorated boolean.
    We can use the pointer to the decoration object now instead.
  * view: Drop view_get_deco_box.
    Now unused
  * xdg-shell: Use typedefs for enums and structs
  * layer-shell: Use typedefs for enums and structs
  * licenses: Move to LICENSES/ and add missing ones.
    This also helps us to use `reuse` out of the box
  * protocols: Add copyright header to phosh-private
  * treewide: Add a bunch of missing copyright header
  * treewide: Use GPL-3.0-or-later consistently
  * reuse: Add licensing information
  * ci: Check copyright and licenses via reuse
  * desktop: Use g_new0. Avoids possible NULL dereference
  * seat: Guard against NULL focus
  * layer-shell-effects: Guard against NULL output
  * view: Add G_NORETURN.
    This makes building with clang less noisy
  * testlib: Add G_NORETURN.
    This makes building with clang less noisy
  * build: Disable -Wcast-align with clang.
    This tiggers for Wayland's wl_container_of() where it doesn' matter for
    us.
  * keybindings: Drop unused function
  * phosh-private: Cast enum.
    Silences the clang warning (and we already co it just above the
    assignment).
  * ci: Add clang build
  * cursor: Drop unused assignment in handle_shell_reveal
    wlr_layer_surface_v1_try_from_wlr_surface is only used to check
    if it's a layer-surface, we don't need the assigned value.
    While at that make things a bit easier to read.
    Fixes: 8c363c72 ("cursor: Convert to try_from")
  * desktop: Drop unused value
  * server: Make session startup failure a critical.
    We exit the compositor so a warning looks like too low severity.
  * server: Avoid shell for argument parsing.
    This avoids yet another exec during session launch.
    See https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phosh/-/merge_requests/1352
  * seat: Grab meta press.
    Instead of just checking if it's pressed grab it so we cancel the
    release event for the meta key "stand alone press".
    This allows to move views via meta + mouse-drag without e.g. bringing up
    phosh's the overview afterwards.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/322
  * keyboard: Remove now unused phoc_keyboard_get_meta_key.
    This prevents some more leaking of keyboard details into the seat.
  * layer-shell: Don't center views unconditionally.
    We only want to do so when using automaximize

phoc (0.35.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * build: Allow to build with released wlroots 0.17.0.
    0.17.0-dev is greater than 0.17.0
  * packging: Fix phosh relationship
    phosh 0.34.0 switched to ext-idle-notify
  * packaging: Drop default -Dembed-wlroots=disabled.
    Otherwise we end up with
      -Dembed-wlroots=disabled -Dembed-wlroots=enabled
    which works but looks confusing.
  * packaging: Install NEWS and manpages.
    Doesn't hurt to have them in the development builds too.
  * build: Spell Xwayland like on wayland.fdo
  * build: Make paths a bit simpler to read.
    Avoid join_path and prefer '/'.
  * build: Format meson options consistently
  * tracing: Add support for systemtap probes.
    We don't add any actual static trace points yet.
  * helpers: Add tracing scripts.
    Add example scripts that help tracing the render loop and with
    activation.
  * tracing: Allow to exempt functions from inlining.
    Allow to exempt functions from inlining when tracing is enabled.
  * output: Don't inline frame submission.
    Don't inline frame submission when tracing is enabled
  * packaging: Allow to enable tracing via a build profile
  * d/control: Bump wlroots dependency to 0.17.0 too.
    As we're building with the embeded variant only in CI noone noticed yet.
  * wlroots: Bump to 0.17.1
  * xdg-shell: Set mapped before damaging popup.
    Otherwise the following phoc_view_child_damage_whole() will
    always return early as the view isn't mapped yet.
  * output: Drop support for surface rotation.
    We're not using it, it complicates the code and it was broken
    as we generated rotated boxes (e.g. in render_texture() and
    get_surface_box() but never used them.
  * utils: Remove now unused rotated bounds helpers.
    We do this in a separate commit so they can be brought back
    easily if needed.
  * xdg-shell: Fix popup reposition damage.
    Since 40fa76e34f1b4c33c09c377095e7ff9b4897aa55 we don't damage the whole
    view containing a popup but only the popup itself reducing the damage
    submitted. This worked well until we switched to xdg-shell >= 3 where
    popups can be repositioned leaving traces of the old popup behind.
    This can clearly be seen with GTK's magnifier when selecting text.
    Damage the parent view on reposition to avoid this.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/355
  * view: Take geometry into accout for fullscreen views.
    If we hit the direct scanout path geometry doesn't matter for the
    rendered surface but when the user e.g. opens a popup we hit the
    rendering path and we need to take geometry into account as otherwise the
    surface is shifted towards the bottom right edge.
    This also fixes UI elements not being responsive in fullscreen.

  * keyboard: Don't ever blank output on power button press.
    The shell can do this nowadays.
  * desktop: Drop phoc_desktop_toggle_output_blank.
    Now unused. This removes another place where we manipulate output
    state directly
  * output: Drop pending state tracking.

    render_pass.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/328
  * wlroots: Avoid crash when plugging in new output.
    This is exposed now that we don't commit an enabled state early
    anymore. This only triggers when there's a listener for output state
    configuration changes like phosh.

  * seat: Use simpler wlr_cursor_unset_image
  * Revert "wlroots: Avoid crash when plugging in new output"
    This reverts commit 5772172f679400676daa3fc5de883879b73d54aa.
    Not needed with 0.17
  * output: Use wlr_output_state_init.
    See wlroots commit be050979684ae8779a56e4b0166cfb21d1935d35
  * cursor: Remove unused variable
  * phosh-private: Use wlr_buffer_try_from_resource.
    See wlroots commit 8ccbe45143eff1705c0516bcdb02376d7d627198
  * render: Use wlr_output_is_direct_scanout_allowed.
    This obsoletes the cursor check.
  * desktop: Modernize indent in phoc_desktop_setup_xwayland
  * server: Filter out xwayland-shell-v1. This is only meant for XWayland.
  * phosh-private: Allow to get global
  * layer-shell-effects: Allow to get global
  * desktop: Assign more protocols.
    We want these for security context checks
  * desktop: Create security_context_manager_v1
  * desktop: Add check for privileged protocols.
    Allow to easily check if a global belongs to a privileged protocol
    that shouldn't be exported to untrusted clients.
  * server: Don't expose globals of privileged protocols to untrusted clients.
    Clients that have a security-context-v1 attached shouldn't see those
    globals so filter them out.
    This is inspired by sway's MR https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/7648
  * ci: Modernize sanitizer build. It won't build on such old versions
  * ci: Use image with updated dependencies. This will allow us to recurring
    package installations from CI
  * ci: Simplify image update
  * ci: Install dependencies for doc build and XWayland into image.
    Speeds up CI. We also add uncrustify as this will become useful
    for formatting checks soon.
  * ci: Install build-deps for embedded wlroots build into the image.
    This speeds up ci. Since we install with --no-install-recommends we need
    to add more build-deps to ensure the x11 backends stays buildable.
  * ci: Install ci deps into the image. Speeds up CI.
  * treewide: Fix indent start columns in function bodies.
    Several places either didn't indent by two spaces or misaligned under
    opening braces or in switch statements. Fix that.
  * treewide: Fix function definition opening brace.
    We want it on a separate line. Fix places where that is off.
  * treewide: Fix initial column of function parameters.
    We want their types vertically aligned. Fix places where that's not the
    case.  We don't bother alligning the parameter names yet.
  * treewide: Fix function definition return types indent.
    Make sure they're on a separte line
  * treewide: Fix function call argument indent.
    Function call parameters are separated by ", ".
  * treewide: Avoid space before array brackets
  * ci: Run merge requests in merge request pipelines.
    This gives us access to more varibles so we can e.g. diff against
    the base branch.
  * ci: Check style in merge requests
  * testlib: Print filename of failed screenshot
  * output: Move output configuration handling to separate function
  * output: Allow to test output config changes.
    Another TODO done.
  * output: Simplify
  * settings: Drop unused includes
  * output: Move output state configuration to separate function.
    This makes phoc_output_initable_init() easier to read and will allow us
    to reapply output config from other places too.
  * output: Simplify enable during output setup.
    Do this upfront which saves us one indentation level
  * output: Use wlr_output_layout_add_auto if position isn't specified.
    This gives a better automatic layout if multiple outputs are specified
    in the configuration file but not all of them have a position.
    So far they would all be put at 0,0.
  * ci: Move style checks to separate stage.
    Style checks often fail due to minor nits. When looking at the pipeline
    state we want to see at a single glance if this is just a style check or
    maybe an asan failure.
    So make sure these aren't in the same stage.
  * treewide: Drop unused version.h include
  * desktop: Add phoc_desktop_find_output_by_name
  * cursor: Identify relative pointer motion
  * seat: Don't forget to map pointers.
    This unbreaks running nested phoc with multiple outputs
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/347
  * settings: Split output name on '%'
    Space is too common in EDID names. An alternative would be to reverse
    the matching by constructing the string from the output information but
    that's again fragile.
  * settings: Allow for wildcards in output matches
  * doc: Add manpage for phoc.ini
  * build: Make it simple to switch glib versions
  * build: Assume glib 2.74 as baseline.
    It's in Debian stable
  * server: Use g_spawn_check_wait_status. No need to care about older glib.
  * gmobile: Switch to 0.0.4
  * view: Use MIN() MIN() is easier to read than open coding it
  * layer-shell-effects: Use MIN() and MAX(). Easier to read
  * cursor: Use MAX(). Easier to read
  * seat: Avoid misplacing when dragging maximized views.
    If a toplevel is maximized initially there's no saved width or height.
    Use the maximized width/height in this case. Otherwise the toplevel's top
    left corner suddenly jumps to the cursor position when dragging this
    toplevel via mouse pointer from it's maximized state.
    This can be reproduced with firefox. Use
       WLR_BACKENDS=wayland   _build/src/phoc -E firefox
    and maximize firefox. Then close firefox. This will make it restore
    the maximized state on next startup:
       WLR_BACKENDS=wayland   _build/src/phoc -E firefox
    Now drag the window on the titlebar and notice the top left corner
    jumping to the cursor position. With this patch this will no longer
    happen.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/349
  * server: Don't crash when wl-display was never inited.
    This can happen when we hit another failure early.
  * server: Enable linux dmabuf.
    This was so far inited implicitly via wlr_renderer_init_wl_display.
    See https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/350
  * view: Send linux_dmabuf_feedback_v1 for fullscreen views.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/350
  * output: Don't forget to free output pending state struct.
    This wasn't much of a problem as we don't set LUT or damage via this yet
    but it's good to have it cleaned up.
  * output: Wire up gamma-control handler.
    See wlroots commit 36376e2ddf0d16baae37e6b733f0baf53f82ebb7
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/348
  * packaging: Drop unneeded build-deps.
    The clients have been dropped from wlroots source tree.
  * subprojects: Use depth=1 for wlroots too.
    We can depthen the shallow clone if needed for development.
  * subprojects: Update wlroots to 0.17.0
  * ci: Don't enforce non-embedded wlroots for doc build.
    Not needed and can break the build.
  * ci: Improve uncrustify config
    - Automatically drop braces on single line statements
    - Remove duplicate semicolons
    - Remove superfluous braces in case statements
  * cursor: Don't forget to update the drag icons position.
    We also need to move the icon when using touch.
  * seat: Handle drag icon hotspot position.
    The position is sent via wl_surface.offset requests.
  * render: Remove unused render-start signal.
    It wasn't a great idea as we'd better handle it per output
  * output: Move render invocation to separate function
  * render: Move sending frame-done events to output.
    It's not related to any rendering. No functional change.
  * render: Move scan_out_fullscreen_view to output.
    There's no rendering going on.
  * output: Mostly move damage ring handling to output.
    Even after moving the full screen view scan out and the frame-done
    event handling the current render pass is a mixed bag of rendering,
    adding additional damage for debug options (touch-points, damage) and
    committing the new output state.
    As a next step move the rotation of the damage ring and the output
    commit out of the render_output call.
    This makes the render flow easier to track. We pass the render context
    around for that and hence make it public. Context is a slightly better
    fit than the generic data.
  * render: Move adding the frame damage to the output.
    The renderer isn't involved.
  * output: Don't forget to submit the frame callback list.
    This fixes some clients only making progress e.g. on cursor movement
    (when there's actual damage submitted)
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/354

phoc (0.33.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * seat: Use phoc_desktop_notify_activity to notify idle activity.
    This will allow us to notify idle via different protocols
  * cursor: Use phoc_desktop_notify_activity to notify idle activity.
    This will allow us to notify idle via different protocols
  * desktop: Notify via idle-ext-notify-v1 too.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/339
  * protocols: Rename server_protocols to wayland_protocols.
    We build them for servers and clients
  * protocols: Allow to build protocols for client use only.
    Less targets, faster build. Initial one is ext-idle-notify-v1.
  * examples: Add example idle client.

phoc (0.32.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * device-state: Assert on invalid values in switch statement.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/334
  * view: Reindent view_center.
    We'll do some more changes there
  * view: Always pass PhocOutput when an output is needed.
    This boosts readability as we no longer have phoc_output, wlr_output
    and output (the later sometimes meaning a PhocOutput and sometimes
    a wlr_output). We also don't have to guess on function alements.
    Another cleanup series finished.
  * view: Nuke view_get_output. Use phoc_view_get_output() everywhere.
  * seat: Make name private
  * seat: Make exclusive client private. We already have getters and setters
  * seat: Make input mapping settings private. Only used within the seat
  * desktop: Reindent input_inhibit related handlers.
    No changes expected here for some time so let's get this sorted out.
    (spotted while looking at phoc_seat_set_exclusive_client).
  * view: Reindent view_maximize. No other changes
  * view: Add phoc_ prefix to view_maximize
  * view,desktop,text-input,layer-shell: Untabify and the reindent remaining
    bits. Since most parts use the "modern" indent let's move over the last
    bits. Other changes kept to a minimum.
  * keybindig: Handle move-to-monitor-{up,down}
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/336
  * xdg-shell: Sort popup signal unregistration.
    Use the opposite order from registration/as they appear in the struct
  * xdg_shell: Move popup_unconstrain further upwards. Code move only so
    other functions can use it.
  * xdg_shell: Handle reposition event. Unconstrain the popup as it can
    otherwise be positioned oddly.
  * view: Use output relative coordinates when damaging whole child view.
    Otherwise we damage the wrong area. This doesn't show with a single
    output at 0,0 but when e.g. doing
       wlr-randr --output eDP-1 --pos 100,100
    and then e.g opening the right click menu in gnome-terminal and closing
    one can see that the content under the menu isn't redrawn properly.
  * layer-shell: Move osk layer switching into a single function.
    Make it public so it can be used from other parts of the compositor
    Fix up some indent around code we'll change in the next commit
  * text-input: Elevate OSK when text input gets enabled.
    When text input gets enabled on a layer surface we possibly need to
    elevate the OSK. This didn't matter until recently when we rearranged
    the layers on every frame as arrange_layers raises the OSK as well.

phoc (0.31.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * ci: Install gcovr.
    Use that instead of lcov to make ninja happy
  * utils: Drop long_side and short_side when calculating scale.
    Otherwise we no longer match the correct width in mm to the
    pixel width and physical height to the pixel height.
  * Add missing includes.
    The modules use wlr_subcompositor or PhocInputMethodRelay
    but didn't include the headers.
  * seat: Add types for GSLists
  * seat: Name `self` as such.
    We're not super consistent in seat.c yet but can fixup functions we
    touch anyway.
  * seat: Make on_tablet_destroy consistent with other on_*_destroy
  * seat: Free device lists
  * virtual: Fix indent
  * pointer: Add missing G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS
  * switch: Make switches GObjects.
    Helps to further unclutter the headers and improves separation: Switch
    notifies and the seat acts on it.
  * seat: Use `self` in seat_add_switch
  * switch: Allow to infer switch type
  * Simplify getting PhocSeat from wlr_seat.
    No need to get an input (which often involves getting the server first)
    and then iterate when we can infer it directly.
  * render: Move wlr_box_from_pixman_box32 past struct declarations
  * render: Untabify phoc_renderer_initable_init.
    This removes the last tab in this file so we can drop it from
    check-indent to not break the tests.
  * render: Use G_LIKELY to check if touch point debugging is disabled.
    It's likely off so let the compiler optimize for that. In cases
    where we iterate over the list we can check that rather than the
    debug flag.
  * render: Move `continue` to separate line.
    While at that fix some other indentation nits in
    collect_touch_points().
  * treewide: Use g_assert consistently.
    We had some remaining plain `assert ()`. This makes sure we can use
    G_DISABLE_ASSERT.
  * cursor: Use G_UNLIKELY for debug flag
  * cursor: Fix indentation
  * cursor: Use explicit cast
    Make use of the full line length and give every protocol that also
    registers signals a small block to ease readability.
    This also gets rid of tabs in that function which made indenting
    harder than necessary.
  * desktop: Enable support for wp_single_pixel_buffer protocol
  * desktop: Fix formatting of handle_xwayland_*
  * Set xwayland seat when XWayland comes up.
    Since XWayland can run on demand setting it only on server startup
    is not enough.
    This unbreaks copy/paste between X11 and Wayland applications as
    selection handling doesn't work without an assigned seat.
    It also prevents emacs from hanging on close when trying to safe the
    clipboard.
  * seat: Rename seat_{set,get}_focus to seat_{set,get}_focus_view.
    This makes it consistent with seat_set_focus_layer().
  * view: Document phoc_view_activate
  * server: Make it simple to get the last focused seat.
    The current server -> input -> seat wasn't nice.
  * view: Reindent and prefix view_initial_focus
  * view: Reindent and prefix view_setup()
  * view: Simplify phoc_view_set_initial_focus()
    Just use phoc_server_get_last_active_seat ()
  * view: Make the activation token a r/o property.
    It's only supposed to be set by derived classes and those can use the
    phoc_view_set_activation_token().
    We could move that method to view-private.h but keep it in view.h
    for the moment to keep code movement at bay.
  * view: Allow to submit and clear the activation token.
    Will be used in follow up commits
  * xdg-activation: Just let the seat handle the activation.
    The token is meant to focus the view so invoke phoc_seat_focus_view()
    and handle the token submission there.
    This also works for yet unmapped view as all view derived classes
    call phoc_view_setup()
           --> phoc_view_set_initial_focus()
             --> phoc_set_set_focus_view ()
  * view: Drag token type around.
    This will allow us to flush tokens for other protocols too
  * gtk-shell: Add TODO.
    We should use the startup-id for activation.
  * xwayland-surface: Use startup_id for activation.
    Instead of just notifying that we received the startup-id use
    it for actual activation.
  * build: Don't redefine PHOC_XWAYLAND for the doc build.
    We bring it in via phoc-config.h already
  * doc-check: Fail on gi-docgen and (most) gir compiler warnings.
    This way we can use it in ci. We filter out some warnings we don't want
    to fix right away.
  * ci: Fail on gi-docgen warnings.
    Let's make sure we catch these.
  * view: Reindent subsurface_destroy.
    We're adding more code around that
  * view: Implement subsurface:get_pos.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/331
  * view: Drop fallback for ChildView without get_pos.
    It's mandatory now
  * render: No need to schedule frame after adding touch point damage
    damage_touch_point_cb invokes wlr_output_damage_add which does that
    already.
  * render: Move damage checking to a separate function
  * render: Stay clear of wlr_ namespace.
    We use `box` instead of `wlr_box` in function and method names elsewhere.
    This makes sure a function doesn't look like if it's coming from
    wlroots.
  * output: Move phoc_output_scale_box to utils.
    The output argument is unused. This makes it clearer that we don't care
    about any output rotation or scale in this function.
  * output-shield: Use proper prefix
  * utils: Document phoc_utils_compute_scale
  * treewide: Use explicit cast for wlr_output->data.
    This gives us some additional type checks.
  * desktop: Make it simple to get the output at given layout coordinates
  * cursor: Use phoc_desktop_layout_get_output.
    This simplifies the back and forth between output and
    wlr_output. PhocView's methods will soon switch to using PhocOutput
    rather than wlr_output as arguments which will further simplify this.
  * desktop: Simplify phoc_desktop_surface_at
    wlr_output->data, phoc_output and output all refer to the same output.
    Just use output everywhere.
  * view: Use phoc_desktop_layout_get_output
  * output: Invoke arrange-layers less
    phoc_layer_shell_arrange() needs to be called on mode, scale and
    transform changes to adjust the layer surfaces and available space for
    views. It doesn't need to be called when we only submit damage or attach
    new buffers. This reduces the number of invocations (and hence used CPU
    time).
    Fixes: 3d788792 ("Update to wlroots 0.13 and drop support for older versions")
  * output: Handle mode changes in commit handler.
    No need for an extra listener
  * input: Invoke constructed of parent object first.
    For consistency with other objects, doesn't change anything here.
  * input: Use 'self' in 'handle_new_input'
  * input: Make sure we always add a seat.
    Otherwise the headless backend doesn't expose a wl_seat which makes it
    hard to use for tests.
  * layer-shell-effects: Drop version.
    We want to check resource versions anyway so no need to track
    the passed in version.
  * desktop: Make phoc specific protocols private.
    We want to empty out PhocDesktop and as we add a new protocol
    this is another step in that direction.
  * input: Add a doc string for phoc_input_get_seat()
  * seat: Introduce private struct.
    As with other objects we don't want to make more internal members
    public. So introduce a private struct and should we have all members
    private we can drop this again.
    Let's start with PhocInput which will already help to e.g. unclutter
    headers further.
    There's a bunch of easy follow ups like the device lists.
  * switch: Allow to query switch by type.
    We use wlroots enums for the switch types.
  * seat: Update capabilities for seat on switch changes too.
    We want to update the device state caps as well.
  * Add phoc-device-state-unstable protocol.
    This is meant to inform interested clients about hardware device state
    not handled via wl_seat's capabilities. This for now includes lid
    and tablet mode switches but we can also extend that to cover hardware
    keyboards later.
    The `PhocSeat` dispatches between the signals emitted from the
    `PhocSwitch` and the device-state protocol so we keep the switch
    itself clear from caring about any protocol details.
    Can be tested via the `device-state` example.
    Helps: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/320
  * switch: Keep track of switch state.
    This allows us to query the switch state at any time and not only when
    receiving events.
  * device-state: Send initial switch state.
    Whenever a client connects send the switch state if known
  * build: Bump required meson version to 0.63.0
    diff_files was only introduces there and 1.0 is in Debian stable
  * property-easer: Allow for unsigned int properties too
  * output: cache renderer.
    We need the renderer at different places, no need to get it over
    and over again.
  * view: Add method to get dimensions of the maximized box
  * view: Use phoc_view_get_maximized_box in phoc_view_arrange_maximized.
    Note that we don't take the geometry into account as this is the
    clients geometry prior to resize anyway.
  * view: Add method to get dimensions of the tiled box
  * view: Use phoc_view_get_tiled_box in phoc_view_arrange_tiled
  * output: Keep the outputs layout coordinates around.
    We need them ever so often
  * output: Simplify phoc_output_get_decoration_box.
    By using phoc_utils_scale_box we also handle fractional scaling better.
  * output: Make it simple to submit damage
  * Add boxed types for colors and boxes.
    We want to use these as GObject properties so create
    thin wrappers.
  * Add an interface to render blings.
    To attach some graphical sugar in various spaces of the compositor
    add an interface the objects can implement to get rendered.
    This will allow us to have e.g. additional rects or quads in various
    places when needed. We can combine this nicely with PhocTimedAnimation.
  * view: Allow to add and render blings.
    These are currently all rendered before the view.
  * view: Add TODO.
    We want decorations to use the bling interface too
  * Add support for using colored rectangles as blings.
    This allows them to be rendered e.g. when attached to views.
  * output-shield: Add TODO.
    The PhocOutputShields can use a PhocColorRect
  * cursor: Suggest window state changes.
    Instead of changing the size right away suggest the new size when tiling
    and maximizing and only resize if still within the threshold when
    releasing the button.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/309
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/203
  * cursor: Make phoc_cursor_handle_constraint_commit static.
    Not needed outside the cursor code.
  * cursor: Drop unnused view parameter from phoc_cursor_submit_pending_view_state_change
  * cursor: Don't forget to apply state changes with touch.

      meson setup _build
  * ci: Set defaults.
    This e.g. allows to interrupt builds on new commits
    Taken verbatim from phosh.
  * build: Use project_source_root.
    Avoids a meson deprecation warning.
  * build: Avoid cc.getdefine for subproject.
    Otherwise we fail with
       ERROR:  Dependencies must be external dependencies
    See https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/4800
  * packaging: Reset dh's wrap-mode.
    We want to fallback for gmobile to have it available.
  * build: Use meson wrap for the wlroots submodule.
    This makes it more obvious what we're tracking and it gives
    us a git archive after all so local development doesn't get
    more complicated.
  * build: Use meson wrap for the gmobile submodule.
    It's a bit easier to handle than the git submodule giving us an explicit
    reference in the source tree. It will then also be simpler to switch to
    the shared library version once we have a stable API.
  * build: No need to update git submodules anymore
  * build: Fetch wlroots from the official repo.
    This finally makes sure we don't have to mess with forks
    somewhere. We still should upstream the one patch.
  * desktop: Bump xdg-shell to 5.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/324
  * xdg-shell: Set capabilities.
    Phoc doesn't provide right click menus or minimize.
  * view: Use `self` in map.
    Old code parts use `view`, let's update this when making other changes.
    See HACKING.
  * view: Allow to retrieve pid.
    This can be useful for force killing and supsending apps
  * layer-shell-effects: Use wlr_layer_surface_v1_from_resource.
    Available in 0.16
  * output: Move public damage handling closer together
  * output: Document some more functions
  * xdg_shell: Use PhocXdgPopup consistently.
    Avoids confustion whether PhocXdgPopup and struct phoc_xdg_popup
    are the same type.
  * view: Implement phoc_view_child_damage_whole for popups.
    So far we damaged the parent surface which doesn't work well when the
    popup extends out of the parent. It also avoids that we submit way
    more damage than necessary.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/325

  * treewide: Follow event rename for wlroots 0.16.
    Events are now names wlr_<event_type>_event instead of
    wlr_event_<event_type>. E.g. wlr_touch_motion_event
  * treewide: Get event device from touch, pointer, etc.
    The event does no longer carry the wlr_input_device. It's embedded
    as base class in e.g. wlr_{touch,pointer,...} now.

  * xdg-surface: Adjust to toplevel changes
    wlr_xdg_toplevel_* now take a toplevel rather than a wlr_xdg_surface
  * Adjust popups to 0.16 API changes
  * render: read_pixels dropped it's flag argument
  * seat: Signals are now attached without the devices indirection
  * Adjust includes
  * server: Init subcompositor responsible for subsurfaces
  * keyboard: End touch grab in Escape key binding.
    Pointer and keyboard grabs are ended here, but touch has been forgotten.
  * seat: End keyboard grab in set_focus_layer.
    This matches what set_focus does for regular views already.
  * cursor: Ignore touch grab when interacting with layer-surfaces.
    This is needed in order to be able to use the shell (including virtual
    keyboard) while some client has a xdg-popup grab without dismissing that
    popup right away.

  [ Newbyte ]
  * NEWS: Fix typo.

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * layer-shell: Make find_osk public.
    This is going to be useful in order to reveal shell when fullscreen view
    requests the keyboard and to draw the keyboard inside window thumbnails.
  * output: Reveal the shell when a fullscreen view requests the keyboard.
    Without that, the keyboard would stay hidden unless the user revealed
    shell surfaces manually.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * output: Only care about mapped views when checking shell reveal.
    This avoids when a surface is marked to become fullscreen but isn't mapped
    yet (doesn't have a wlr_surface attached).
    This happens e.g. when starting electron apps fullscreen.
  * layer-surface: Allow to get and set alpha
  * output: Make layer surface iterator public.
    Name it consistently with the view iterator. We need a forward
    declaration of PhocLayerSurface until we cleanup up more headers.
  * output: Add helper to get layer surfaces in render order.
    We need this in several places.
  * render: Allow to use alpha for layer surfaces
  * layer-shell-effects: Drop unused destroy signal
  * layer-shell-effects: Allow to set surface alpha.
    Extend the protocol with a new effect that allows to set a layer
    surface's alpha value. Bump the protocol version for that.
  * layer-shell-effects: Fix surface typos
  * examples: Allow to test layer surface alpha.
  * layer-shell-effects: Add a test for setting alpha.
    We skip this under pixman. wlroots 0.16 should allow us to
    enable this test permanently.
  * property-easer: Document that we don't ref the object.
    This makes sure that easing of properties stops as soon as the object
    that we track is disposed.
  * desktop: Remove unused code.
    Fixes: a8992d3124442c19d65d1db66ba35727c80ec3f4
  * desktop: Dispose settings
  * desktop: Make settings private.
    We'll add more settings and that makes sure they're in one place
  * desktop: Track whether animations should be used.
    Track the enable-animations GSetting to figure out if we want
    to use animations in the compositor.
    We also add a debug flag to disable animations from the command
    line or in tests.
  * tests: Disable animations.
    Disable animations so the screenshots continue to work. For that
    pass the debug flags to the created compositor.
  * output: Mark cutout texture rendering as unlikely.
    It's a debugging tool after all
  * animatable: Improve documentation
  * timed-animation: Allow to dispose animations when done.
    Setting the dispose-on-done property will dispose the animations so it
    doesn't need to be tracked.
  * tests: Add simple tests for timed animation
  * output: Implement animatable interface.
    This makes it very simple to use an output to drive a
    PhocTimedAnimation without requiring the animated object
    to implement PhocAnimatable itself.
    We currently ignore the case of the output going away while the
    animatable is being driven.
  * view: Add getter for output.
    We want to make all of View's methods use PhocOutput instead of
    wlr_output but let's do that later to avoid more noise.
  * view: Make surface alpha a property
  * view: Animate surface map.
    We fade the surface of a stack in when animations are enabled.
  * view: Make want_automaximize public.
    This can be useful elsewhere and we'd need to move it up anyway
    (or add a forward declaration) as we want to use it in view_map.
  * view: Disable fade in animation when automaximize is in use.
    While the fade in would be nice for slow staring apps (where splash is
    already gone) it introduces flicker for applications using
    xdg-activation. This can be fixed once we landet the xdg-activation
    cleanups.
  * tests: Disable animation for xdg-decoration test.
    The other tests have it disabled.
    Fixes 4a107d661e51f7d0b962c14829aacb2f8e4e36b1
  * layer-shell: Avoid crash when surfaces width or height become negative.
  * Allow to cycle backwards through windows

  [ Alistair Francis ]
  * keyboard: Forward on the super key if pressed by itself.
    If the super key is the only key pressed (so it isn't used as a
    modifier) we want to pass the event onto Phosh. This handles the complex
    logic of looking for the key being pressed and released in Phoc allowing
    Phosh to just easily react to the event.

    We'll cleanup that call sites.
  * xwayland: Drop PhocXWaylandSurface from header

  * xwayland-surface: Use `self` instead of `phoc_surface`
    Now that the code is moved over to the class implementation use self
    consistently
  * server: Set flags early. This makes sure that e.g. PhocDesktop can access
    these during construction.
  * server: Add a flag to start XWayland.  This allows us to enable XWayland

  * main: Add command line flag to launch XWayland.  Can be useful when
    XWayland is disabled in the config
  * ci: Install xwayland. Just until we updated the image
  * tests: Allow to pass flags when creating the compositor
  * tests: Add initial XWayland test.  This makes it simple to check that we
    didn't break things completely.

  * view: Make toplevel-handle private.
  * view: Make child_surfaces private
  * view: Move private functions to separate header.
    Reduce view's API surface by moving functions that are meat to be only
    used by derived classes of view into a private header.
  * testlib: Allow to create xdg toplevels without a buffer.
    This is needed for finer grained tests where we want more control
    over the attached buffer. It's also useful for toplevel-decoration
    which wants the decoration set before the buffer is attached.
  * testlib: Handle empty buffers graciously.  This helps when we e.g. create
    a PhocTestXdgToplevelSurface but never fill the buffer.
  * protocols: Generate headers for xdg-toplevel-decoration-unstable-v1
  * tests: Bind bind xdg-toplevel-decoration-unstable-v1
  * tests: Add test for toplevel decoration
  * xdg-shell: Reindent according to codestyle
  * xdg-shell: Use g_assert ()
  * xdg-shell: Don't crash when decoration goes away before the surface.
    This is a protocol error but we need to guard against it nevertheless.
  * ci: Add python3-docutils. We can drop this when we update the image
  * doc: Add a manpage.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/245
  * event: Drop duplicate Return: doc
  * timed-animation: Remove frame callback after the animation ended.
    If we remove the callback based on the time for the next frame we fail
    to render the last frame of the animation.
  * layer-shell-effects: Don't remove signals when layer-surface is already gone.
    The client should destroy the effects first but we shouldn't crash if it
    doesn't.
  * xdg-surface: Drop xdg_surface_from_view() Just use the type case generated
    by glib.
  * view: Reindent several functions according to codestyle
  * view: Use g_free()
  * view: Make several members private 
  * output: Use phoc_view_is_mapped()
  * text_input: Use phoc_view_is_mapped()
  * view: Make get_wlr_surface_at a virtual functions.
    This unclutters the code in PhocDesktop's view_at
  * testlib: Fix transfer annotations
  * settings: Reindent according to codestyle
  * settings: Match on PhocOutput.
    Follow the pattern that we want to pass Phoc* objects around
    to public functions
  * output: Allow to get the output's name
  * settings: Avoid peeking into wlr_output for vendor/make/model
  * settings: Use GSList for output list.
    While at that add phoc_output_config_{new,destroy} to make
    the code a bit more expressive.
  * settings: Use less generic name for config loading function
  * settings: Split config loading and path handling.
    This will allow us to load config from e.g. memory too
  * settings: Allow to parse data from memory
  * server: Use config object rather than file path.
    This allows to create servers from in memory data. We could move the
    flags and debug_flags here too.
  * settings: Add automatic cleanup
  * settings: Use a GSList for the modes
  * tests: Add config parsing tests
  * server: Deduplicate XWayland config.
  * build: Drop config.h template.  Makes sure we don't have to maintain
    variables in two places
  * build: Add an app-id for phoc
  * build: Setup i18n. This will allow us to use translations
  * main: Init gettext. This allows us to have translated strings in the
    compositor
  * view: Add getter for app-id
  * idle-inhibit: Use app-id of inhibiting view if possible.
    If we have an app-id for the view that inhibits idle use it's app-id
    when requesting the inhibitor.
    This makes sure applications listing inhibitors can print information
    about the inhibiting application. This is e.g. the case for phosh's
    end-session-dialog.
  * data: Add and install desktop file
  * packaging: Install new files. Switch to dh 13 so we detect missing files.
  * render: Fix surface counting in count_surface_iterator.
    We need to increment the value at the pointer location, not the pointer.
    This fixes fullscreen views with popovers as scan_out_fullscreen_view
    now detects these correctly.

    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/442>
  * layer-shell-effects: Document that effects should be destroyed before layer-surface.
    This was unspecified before. We'll enforce that in a later version.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/442>

    with other functions.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/443>
  * xdg-surface: Drop xdg_surface_from_view()

  * settings: Avoid peeking into wlr_output for vendor/make/model.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/444>
  * settings: Use GSList for output list.
    While at that add phoc_output_config_{new,destroy} to make
    the code a bit more expressive.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/444>
  * settings: Use less generic name for config loading function.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/444>
  * settings: Split config loading and path handling.
    This will allow us to load config from e.g. memory too
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/444>
  * settings: Allow to parse data from memory.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/444>
  * server: Use config object rather than file path.
    This allows to create servers from in memory data. We could move the
    flags and debug_flags here too.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/444>
  * settings: Add automatic cleanup.

    Having it as flag and config option was duplication. Now that we have
    pulled config parsing out of the server itself we can deduplicate it.

  * build: Add an app-id for phoc.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/446>
  * build: Setup i18n.
    This will allow us to use translations
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/446>
  * main: Init gettext.
    This allows us to have translated strings in the compositor
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/446>
  * view: Add getter for app-id.
    Part-of: <https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/446>
  * idle-inhibit: Use app-id of inhibiting view if possible.
    If we have an app-id for the view that inhibits idle use it's app-id
    when requesting the inhibitor.
    This makes sure applications listing inhibitors can print information
    about the inhibiting application. This is e.g. the case for phosh's
    end-session-dialog.

  * render: Fix surface counting in count_surface_iterator.
    We need to increment the value at the pointer location, not the pointer.
    This fixes fullscreen views with popovers as scan_out_fullscreen_view
    now detects these correctly.

phoc (0.26.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Affe Null ]
  * Implement input method keyboard grab.
    Based on https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/4932

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * layer-surface: Fix indentiation.
    We indent by two spaces, sigh.
  * layer-surface: Fix indent
  * desktop: Reformat and rename signal handler.
    Make it match coding style before we make more changes.
  * desktop: Avoid dereferencing desktop->output.
    This avoids another direct member access.
  * renderer: Reformat iterators.
    We're getting closer to have this file consistent as well.
  * output: Tweak format of phoc_output_layer_handle_surface.
    It's all about reading speed
  * layer-shell-effects: Fix confusing variable name.
    It's a PhocLayerSurface not a wlr_layer_surface
    Fixes an overly eager replacement in
    92f9365ba68878701902280d283f58122a6b614b
  * xdg-shell: Use type casts.
    It was quite a bit of work to make PhocView a parent of PhocXdgSurface
    so lets leverage this by using GObject's generated type casts instead of
    direct member access.
    Enhances 83f96cfef3186a1e34f20fc61b13337990309160
  * xwayland: Use type casts.
    It was quite a bit of work to make PhocView a parent of PhocXwayland so
    lets leverage this by using GObject's generated type casts instead of
    direct member access.
    Enhances 83f96cfef3186a1e34f20fc61b13337990309160
  * cursor: Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines
  * input-device: Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines
  * gesture-single: Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines
  * input: Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines
  * main: Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines
  * virtual: Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines
  * xdg-surface: Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines
  * output: Check enable pending state when an enable commit is pending.
    This can happen in case of failure and we want to retry
    it in this case.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phosh/-/issues/900
  * xdg-surface: Move all handlers out of xdg_shell.
    This only moves the code, reformatting happens in a later commit.
    For the moment we keep subsurface and popup handling there to keep code
    movement under control.
  * xdg-surface: Wrap phoc_xdg_surface_get_wlr_surface_at.
    This way PhocDesktop doesn't have to worry about the relationship
    between PhocXdgSurface and the resulting wlr_surface avoiding
    direct member access.
  * xdg-surface: Make phoc_xdg_surface_from_view static.
    This just wraps the PHOC_XDG_SURFACE() cast making the code harder to
    read. We can drop it in xdg-surface.c later on too.
  * xdg-surface: Drop PhocXdgSurface definition from header
  * view: Initialize self->desktop in init.
    No point in letting surface specific handlers do it.
  * xdg-surface: Simplify handle_*
    Simplify the functions that were in xdg_shell by using `self`
  * xdg-surface: Reindent class methods
  * xdg-surface: Set view properties during object construction.
    No need to do things at two places. We only leave the app id handling
    behind so we don't leak gtk_shell1 into xdg-surface.
  * xdg_shell: Reindent handle_xdg_shell_surface
  * view: Nuke view type.
    Since we have a type system we don't need to store it explicitly.  We'll
    be able to eliminate lots of special casing later on by using class
    virtual function fields.
  * view: Make alpha private
  * view: Make scale private
  * view: Add type check asserts to public functions.
    We want to be sure we have the right types there. As we want to use
    phoc_view_get_instance_private we need to drop const from two public
    functions.
  * view: Make view decoration private.
    The current implementation (even before these changes) is not great
    as it hardcoded the parameters in several places but as we don't
    want to risk any functional changes leave it like that a little longer.
    It'll need more work once we improve decorations visually anyway.
  * view: Reindent state getters.
    They're one liners and we'll add more code.
  * view: Make state private
  * Fix indentation in mixed tabs vs space lines.
  * helpers: Add indent test.
    For now we test for tab instead of whitespace but keep a list of files
    to clean up.
  * Drop unused code in several places
  * layer-shell-effects: Don't leak drag-surface in error path
  * main: Use G_NORETURN.
    Avoids a clang warning
  * main: Don't fail on format-nonliteral.
    There's not much we can do about the warning itself as we need
    to pass the format on to g_logv().
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/173
  * build: Don't cover submodules.
    They have their individual coverage
  * ci: Allow doc build fail.
    We ignored this as we hit a gi-docgen crash. This was fixed with
    82a162004a2cef0a444cac43cb8f5ce455cdd125.
  * ci: Use meson where possible.
    Consistent with e.g. phosh and avoids warnings
  * build: Set fast_unwind_on_malloc=0 in tests.
    Makes ASAN simpler (we have that in phosh since some time) as
    we get better backtraces of the allocations.
  * render: Destroy wlr_renderer on finalize
  * render: Don't forget to chain up in finalize.
    This had no bad consequences in practice so far as the renderer class
    doesn't do much yet.
    This lets the `run` and `server` tests pass under ASAN.
  * output: Avoid changing the list we iterate over.
    This avoids an illegal access on shutdown when the compositor
    is used with another client and phosh is started separately.
  * event: Add function for automatic cleanup
  * cursor: Don't leak PhocEvent.
    Fixes a8992d3124442c19d65d1db66ba35727c80ec3f4
  * layer-shell-effects: Don't leak hashmap
  * tests: Add leak suppressions
  * tests/testlib: Add a helper to update the attached buffer
  * tests/testlib: Don't forget to cleanup the cairo surfaces in image comparisons
  * tests/testlib: Don't leak test filename
  * tests/testlib: Don't forget to disconnect test client from the display
  * tests/testlib: Destroy globals on client cleanup
  * tests/testlib: Don't leak toplevel handle
  * tests/property-easer: Don't leak cmp_obj.
    We get a ref from g_object_get ().
  * tests/client: Don't leak surface
  * tests/xdg-shell: Rename automaximize check.
    Make it easy to distinguish from maximizing by other means
  * tests/xdg-shell: Test maximization via foreign-toplevel
  * tests/phosh-private: Don't leak keyboard events
  * tests: Don't leak screencopy frames.
    This lets the layer-shell test pass under ASAN
  * tests: Use a single timeout.
    We bump the timeout to 10s to pass under ASAN with
    fast_unwind_on_malloc=0. Individual tests can bump it should
    the need a longer one.
  * ci: Add asan test.
    Run tests under ASAN (based on what phosh does)
  * ci: Add xwayland dependency for alpine.
    Unbreaks the alpine CI pipeline
  * ci: Fix test coverage collection
  * gtk-shell: Include glib.h.
    Needed for G_BEGIN_DECLS and friends
  * leak-suppress: Add suppresson for gvfs.
    See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/-/issues/577. We'll
    need this in the next commit.
  * tests: Wrap in g_test_dbus()
    idle-inhibit will talk to DBus and we don't want to interfere with the
    test system. As this also clears env vars preserve/set them in the test
    fixtures.
  * view: Add mapped property.
    This allows us to connect to `notify::mapped` for map state changes.
  * view: Add "surface-destroy" signal.
    This makes things consistent with the "input-destroy" and
    "output-destroy" signals.
    With that in place we can drop events.{view,destroy} in the view cleanup
    series.
  * Add idle-inhibit implementation.
    This allows programs that don't talk to gnome-session to inhibit screen
    blank (which will also inhibit suspend).
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/143
  * desktop: Wire up idle-inhibit.
    Instead of adding even more to PhocDesktop's public interface add it as
    a instance private instead.
    This will also allow us to make more bits private (and we can drop it
    again once the whole structure becomes private).
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/143
  * keybindings: Document return value
  * keyboard: Clarify doc strings.
    Returning `false` in case the event should be propagated further.  This
    does not necessarily mean it's propagated to wayland clients yet.
  * keyboard: Move state check into the individual functions.
    Let the individual handlers decide if they want to act on key
    press or release. This unclutters `phoc_keyboard_handle_key`
  * phosh-private: Fix description
  * phosh-private: Add missing comment
  * phosh-private: Forward key release as well.
    Forward the key release event so clients can decide whether they
    want to react press or release and do things like long press.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/186
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/248
  * view: Clarify comment
  * view: Reindent resize
  * view: Remove unused variable
  * view: Resize is not optional
  * view: set_activate is not optional.
    Let's drop the check and rename the public method
  * view: Use self in view_resize ()
  * view: Make view_resize static and prefix.
    It's only used in PhocView
  * view: Move resize is not optional so no need to have fallback code
  * view: Reindent view_resize
  * view: Prefix view_resize
  * view: Document optional virtual methods.
    Mark those as optional that have a fallback *and* where at least
    one of the derived classes doesn't provide an implementation.
  * view: Remove checks for set_maximized.
    It's implementation is mandatory
  * view: Add default implementation for for_each_surface.
    Instead of checking if there is an implementation and falling back
    provide a default implementation.
  * view: Add default implementation for get_geometry.
    Instead of checking if there is an implementation and falling back
    provide a default implementation.
  * view: Remove unused code in view_move
  * view: Add default implementation for move.
    Instead of checking if there is an implementation and falling back
    provide a default implementation.
  * view: Make tile direction private.
    Just a matter of using the already present getter
  * view: set_fullscreen is not optional.
    So drop the check
  * view: want_auto_maximize is not optional.
    So drop the check
  * view: Close is not optional.
    So remove check and add prefix
  * view: Add fallback for set_tiled virtual method
  * view: Make required virtual functions purely virtual.
    This makes sure we don't forget to implement them on new view types
    of when refactoring code.

phoc (0.25.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * build: Untabify
  * build: Use summary.
    More in line with other projects and uses colors
  * output: Add getters for scale.
    We want to get rid of direct member access
  * server: Use g_clear_handle_id.
    Less code and easier to read.
  * server: Add getter for desktop.
    Will allow us to reduce direct member access, similar to the renderer.
    We're not updating existing code yet to keep the diff noise under
    control.
  * settings: Strip whitespace from value.
    No need to fail parsing due to this
  * output: Move enums before type definition.
    Just to match coding style, no functional change.
  * build: Build static and shared lib.
    Otherwise gir fails as it trips on the not resolved symbols from
    gmobile.
  * build: Drop gtk_doc vs embedded wlroots restriction.
    With a shared libphoc this works too (see previous commit)
  * Add gmobile as git submodule.
    We're not using the wrap as the submodule makes
    it simpler for distros to bundle it.
  * server: Parse device-tree compatibles.
    This will allow us to query display cutout information for our own
    consumption or to provide it to client.
  * server: Add debug flag to debug cutout information.
    This allows us to overlay the rendering  of notches and cutouts for
    debugging purposes.
  * ouput: Allow to render display cutout.
    This currently is used on all outputs but as it's for debugging
    only that's fine for the moment.
  * Add test data for a tiny layout.
  * build: Bump meson dependency to 0.56.0
  * build: Avoid deprecated get_pkgconfig_variable()
  * build: Avoid deprecated build_root()
  * build: Use a static dependency to link phoc.
    Otherwise it defaults to dynamic linking and we don't want to
    ship a libphoc atm.
  * ci: Switch to Debian bookworm
  * ci: Update base image.
    It's been a while
  * d/control: Use packaged gi-docgen.
    It trickled into distributions.
  * xdg-activation: Fix indentation
  * keyboard: Minor indentation cleanup.
    Make the 'Handle translated keysyms' part match the 'Handle raw
    keysyms'. It took me a second to convince myself that they match.
  * keyboard: Fix indentation.
    We want the opening brace of a function on a new line
  * keyboard: Check the power key after subscribed bindings.
    This gives clients the possibility to listen to power button presses.

phoc (0.24.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * doc: Add small getting started document.
    Add some hints how to run phoc from sources on constrained
    devices like phones.
  * server: Align enum valus at '='
    This matches what we e.g. do in view.h.
  * layer-shell-effects: Use wlr_layer_surface consistently.
    This is similar in spirit than 88b1550aff32c639b1056ee76207295cb46723f5
    and helps to identify the types in use.
  * layer-shell: Remove unused parameter
  * layer-surface: Fix names for output list.
    The list members are PhocLayerSurface and on the output it's
    called layer_surfaces.
    Fixes: afae4a3a ("output: Use a single list for all layer surfaces")
  * layer-shell: Allow to dump layer-surfaces.
    Add a debug option to figure out the current layer surfaces, their order
    and margins.
    This will become more useful with
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/352
    but as it's off by default we can have it right now.
  * layer-shell-effects: Don't assert on NULL layer-surface.
    Don't abort the compositor when the client already destroyed the layer
    surface but not yet the drag surface.
    Except for phoc_draggable_layer_surface_slide the functions
    don't actually access the layer-surface but it's easier to be
    consistent in case we need to access it later on when adding new
    features.
  * layer-shell-effects: Don't access data before asserts.
    Check the data before accessing it. Also clarifies some comments
    related to data access.
  * phoc-layer-shell-effects: Fix argument name.
    We set mode, not state
    Fixes 0820da00 ("Add layer-shell-effects protocol")
  * output: Allow to remove frame callbacks by animatable
  * layer-surface: Remove all frame callbacks on finalize.
    When the object goes away we want to drop all animations. This frees
    users of the animatable interface to worry about when the surface goes
    away since the difference between the wlr-layer-surface's destroy
    signal and finalize can be tricky to track.

phoc (0.23.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * build: Add configure file to generated sources.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/issues/310
  * Rename config.h to phoc-config.h.
    This makes sure we don't accidentally include a config.h from another
    project - e.g. when include paths aren't set up correcty.
  * gitignore: Remove copy / paste artifact.
    Fixes: c960805d9f87c157b4d9b0ae0fadd6cfdad5459b
  * Switch development branch to main (Closes: #256)
  * keybindings: Remove unused property getter / setter
  * keybindings: Don't chain up to contruct twice.
    We already do so at the top of phoc_keybindings_constructed
  * ci: Collect junit reports.
    Phosh added this about 1y ago, let phoc catch up
  * render: Pass wl_shm_buffer to phoc_renderer_render_view_to_buffer.
    So far only the pointer to the data was passed. This is error prone as
    the data pointer is constrained by wl_shm access restrictions. We also
    reduce the number of parameters passed around.
  * render: Don't access interleaving shm buffers
    wl_shm_buffer_{begin,end}_access docs say
    It is safe to nest calls to these functions as long as the nested calls
    are all accessing the same buffer.
    So let's not access interleaving buffers.

  * cursor: g_assert on NULL cursor.
    Don't try to go on without a cursor (which can only happen when calloc
    fails). wlroots also only returns NULL in case of memory problems. This
    allows to remove the NULL checks elsewhere
  * tests/phosh: Use GrabStatus.
    The current accelerator tests try to encode two boolean values
    into two variables making it a bit hard to read. Use a single
    enum instead.
  * tests/phosh: Make tested keybindins more obvious.
    Currently one needs to look up what's tested in an array but each most
    of the keys are only used a single time. So drop that array and use a
    define for the single key that is used multiple times so it's clear we
    just add an accelerator.
  * tests/phosh: Set and check both test vars.
    Always set and check both keybinding results. This tests that
    we don't invoke the wrong callback accidentally.
  * phosh: Don't crash when we failed to parse the accelerator.
    Passing an invalid keybinding otherwise doesn't end well.
  * phosh: Allow to bind misc keys.
    Until we allow to bind all keys let's allow for these as well since

  * desktop: Refresh all views when auto-maximize changes.

phoc (0.1.8) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * d/control: Bump wlroots dependency.
    Bumped to 0.10.0 since this is sufficient to build and run
    although 0.10.1 is preferred.
  * build: Bump project version.
    This makes it match the version in the changelog
  * PhocServer: Move startup command from config.
    No need to tuck away the command we run in config, it's only
    configurable via the command line.
  * main: Use automtic cleanup for mainloop
  * main: Use automatic cleanup for the server
  * server: Get hold of the main loop.
    This allows the server to exit cleanly
  * server: Exit when session exits.
    This allows e.g. a systemd unit to properly restart compositor
    and shell in case of session crash. It also allows to support
    logout under display managers like GDM.
    Prerequisite for phosh#117 since we also need to updte gnome-session
    for this.
  * Remove output mapping for devices and cursors.
    For cursors we don't have a real use and for devices we're going
    to make this default properly.
  * output: Add helper to detect built-in panels.
    This is similar to what phosh does.
  * roots_seat_configure_cursor: Pass roots_output.
    This avoids going back and forth between roots_ and wlr_output;
  * seat: Map touch screens to build in displays by default.
    This is currently hard coded and can not be changed
  * seat: Map tablet devices as well
  * seat: Fix wrong struct type.
    Touch is not a pointer but 'struct roots_touch'
  * server: Fix odd indentation
  * server: Introduce debug flags.
    This keeps the number of arguments and variables under control.
  * Parse debug flags from environment.
    This makes things more consistent with other glib applications
    and allows us to use expressive comma separated lists instead
    of command line flags.
  * Use PHOC_SERVER_DEBUG_DAMAGE_TRACKING.
    This avoids passing boolean flags around
  * Use PHOC_SERVER_DEBUG_TOUCH_POINTS.
    This avoids passing boolean flags around
  * server: Introduce no-quit debug flag.
    This allow to not quit the session which is useful for e.g.
    phosh development where one wants to replace the running shell
    without the compositor caring.
  * README: Document PHOC_DEBUG
  * gitlab-ci: Enable coverage information
  * README: add coverage information.
    This makes current coverage very visible
  * README: fix cut'n'paste error
  * d/copyright: Use correct licenses.
    As per de56ea6b1e3cfa41981fd4dd349b0eef852aee23 we default to GPL-3+
    (same as phosh). That's also consistent with the COPYING file.
    We keep `src/*` separate to respect the copyright notices brought
    over from rootston and keep the protocols under their initial
    licenses.
  * server: Fix method name.
    We use it as finalize() but called it dispose().
  * Don't destroy xwayland in phoc_server.
    We create it in phoc_desktop so it should be destroyed there as well.
    This also fixes a crash on server shutdown when the desktop wasn't even
    created.
  * server: Track multiple setup.
    We currently track whether the singleton was inited which
    is broken since we have a weak ref. Rather make sure we
    don't setup the instance multiple times.
  * server: Fix error output.
    We only create the backend, it's started later on in _setup().
  * tests: Add simple test that runs a main loop
  * server: Remove wayland source on shutdown
  * server: Unset envvars on shutdown.
    It's always better to clean up but this also allows to run
    two tests using the wayland backend in the same process.
  * tests: Properly finalize the server.
    So far we used the same server instance in all the tests
    which fails when we allow to run init just once.
  * tests: Pass a phoc.ini.
    This one disables Xwayland since that causes trouble when
    restarting it multiple times and we currently don't need it.
  * server: Use self conistently.
    We call the first method argument self elsewhere so this consistently in
    all methods.
  * server: Move wl_display_destroy_clients() to dispose.
    This allows clients to shut down properly, we'll call into
    already freed objects like input.
    Note that wl_display_destroy() was never run since the wl_display was
    already NULL when and we were using g_clear_pointer().
  * server: Call wlr_backend_destroy() in dispose.
    This allows wlroots to clean up and we can call wl_display_destroy ()
    in finalize.
  * input: Guard against NULL input.
    This one pops up often when wlroots or the server cleans
    up and this makes it obvious at a glance what's wrong.
    We can't use PHOC_IS_INPUT yet since it's not a gobject yet.
  * README: document how to run the tests.
    This allows us to mention xvfb-run which is needed for screenshot
    comparison tests.
  * protocols: Generate client protocols.
    These are needed by the tests
  * protocols: Add wlr-screencopy-manager
  * tests: Add testlib.
    This allows to run a wayland client against the compositor
    and to take and compare screenshot of the output. (Closes: #40)
  * tests: Add simple client test.
    This validates that clients can connect and find their globals
    and also demos the library usage.
  * tests: Add layer shell test.
    Initial tests to test layer-shell layout (since we had several
    surprises there). This also demos the screenhost machinery.
    For tests to succeed they need to run under e.g. xfvb since
    the mouse cursor might get placed differently otherwise.
  * gitlab-ci: Don't reset xvfb between test runs.
    This should avoid connection failures with multiple tests. We
    do the same with libhandy.
  * seat: Be consistent with whitespace.
    Let's not mix tab and spaces in the same function.
  * seat: Don't notify activity on `set_cursor`
    Rather notify on tool set_cursor activity where it is important.
    This avoids setting activity events on `set_cursor` when nothing
    really changed.
    To see what thi fixes blank the screen using `lock sreen` in phosh
    with https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/phosh/-/merge_requests/300
    applied and see it wake up right away.
  * desktop: Add getter/setter for maximization
  * tests: testlib: Add server prepare hook.
    This allows to tweak the compositor configuration before
    launching the client
  * tests: Wire up xdg_wm_base.
    This will be used in followup commits for xdg-shell testing
  * tests: Add initial xdg-shell tests
  * output: Enable new outputs by default.
    This was done by wlroots but isn't in 'recent' versions (which gives
    the compositor more room). (Closes: #130)
  * phosh: Drop xdg-switcher interface.
    Instead of requiring a phosh/phoc lockstep upgrade post an error if a
    client wants to bind the protcol. This keeps the code we need carry
    minimal but we can still be backward compatible (this is not breaking
    clients that don't use that part of the protocol).
  * input: Make_device_type() public
    public. While at that rename to phoc_get_device_type ()
  * Rename virtual_keyboard.[ch] to virtual_[ch]
    We handle virtual pointer there as well.
  * virtual: Use g_return_if_fail () instead of wlr_log ()
    We can turn this into a type check later on and it makes
    sure log domains work correctly.
  * Implement virtual pointer protocol

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * d/copyright: fix upstream files list and improve readability

  [ Nícolas F. R. A. Prado ]
  * Use default switch cases where they make sense.
    This removes -Wswitch-default warnings.
  * Use default switch cases to report invalid values.
    This removes -Wswitch-default warnings.
  * Add -Wswitch-default to compile flags

  [ Jordi Masip ]
  * build: add missing dependency 'libdrm' used for 'drmModeModeInfo'

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * cursor: Fix touch point surface attachment.
    Touch points should remain attached to surface they originate from
    regardless of the touch point position on screen.

phoc (0.1.5) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * input: Use g_* for logging.
    This makes log domains work for input as well.
  * seat: Don't initialize tablets if we don't have libinput.
    This leads to crashes otherwise e.g. on the wayland backend
  * phosh: Fix indentation
  * view: Introduce helper to find a roots_surface from a given wlr_surface.
  * protocols: Add gtk-shell v3.
    Taken from gtk 3.24.8. This will allow to implement raising surfaces on
    their request and startup notifications if we want these before there's a
    mainlineable protocol.
  * Implement gtk-shell's handle_request_focus.
    This allows to raise windows on their request.
    See https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/phoc/issues/93
  * desktop: Wire up gtk-shell

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * view: Hide shell overlay when activating a fullscreen window.
    Without that, the overlay stays needlessly visible after selecting a
    fullscreen window in the activity switcher until further input event.

phoc (0.1.4) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * build: drop rootston=false from wlroots submodule build
    rootston is no longer part of wlroots so the option causes
    a warning during build.
  * view: Add helper to move windows between outputs
  * keybindings: allow to move windows to left/right output
  * Update submodule.
    This pulls in the gbm fix.
  * Add doap file.
    This helps to identify project maintainers and contact points.
  * d/control: Add Sebastian to uploaders
  * xdg_shell_v6: Implement get_geometry.
    As long as these are around there's no reason why v6 should
    be worse than stable
  * Introduce view_is_maximized.
    This will allow us to introduce a tiled state as well.
  * view: Simple left right tilig.
    This uses the 'maximized' state to get rid of GTK's drop
    shadows until we have fixed
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/issues/2171
  * view: Differentiate between tiled and normal on unmaximize
  * keybindings: bind left and right tiling
  * d/control: Depend on gsettings schemas.
    Not having them makes us not start

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * Update wlroots submodule.
    Forward to 9fb251c33fc404f106f0b4e3b6839de9d4753a4c for virtual
    keyboard keycode 0 fix.

  [ Simon Ser ]
  * render: set surface as sampled for presentation.
    This is necessary after [1].
    [1]: https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/pull/1798
  * Fix presentation feedback when scanning out fullscreen views.
